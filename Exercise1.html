        <p> <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>The Godfather</u></b></i></span> is a crime novel <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>written by Mario Puzo</u></b></i></span>, originally published in 1969 by <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>G. P. Putnam's Sons</u></b></i></span>. 
            It details the story of a fictitious Sicilian Mafia family based in New York City and headed by <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>Don Vito Corleone</u></b></i></span>, who became synonymous 
            with the Italian Mafia. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also provides the back story of <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>Vito Corleone</u></b></i></span> from 
            early  childhood to adulthood. The book introduced Italian criminal terms like consigliere, caporegime, Cosa Nostra, and 
            omert√† to an English-speaking audience. It formed the basis for a 1972 film of the same name. Two film sequels, including 
            new contributions by <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>Puzo</u></b></i></span> himself, were made in 1974 and 1990. The first and second films are widely considered to be two 
            of the greatest films of all time. The cover was created by <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b><u>S. Neil Fujita</u></b></i></span> whose design featured a large Gothic-style 
            letter "G" with a long curl at the top emphasizing the first three letters of the title, accompanied by the hands of a 
            puppeteer holding a set of strings over the "father" portion of the word.</p>
