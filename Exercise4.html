                <p>In the western Pacific Ocean, the Philippines is a country in Southeast Asia. It is a 7,106-island archipelago located near many of Southeast Asia's major waterways, including the South China Sea, Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea, Celebes Sea, and Luzon Strait. Taiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia are all nearby countries. Mountainous terrain with narrow coastal lowlands characterize the landscape. The president is the chief of state and head of government in the republic government system. The Philippines features a mixed economic system, with a mix of private liberty and centralized economic planning and government regulation. </p>

                <h3 id="Etymology">Etymology</h3>
                <p>Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos, during his voyage in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar "Felipinas" after Philip II of Spain, then the Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name "Las Islas Filipinas" would be used to cover the archipelago's Spanish possessions. Before Spanish rule was established, other names such as Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands, San Lázaro, were also used by the Spanish to refer to islands in the region. During the Philippine Revolution, the Malolos Congress declared the Republic of the Philippines, or Repblica Filipina. From the Spanish–American War (1898) to the Philippine–American War (1899–1902), American colonial authorities referred to the country as The Philippine Islands, a translation of the Spanish name, until the Commonwealth period (1935–1946). When the Philippine Autonomy Act or the Jones Law were mentioned, the United States began the process of altering the country's name from The Philippine Islands to The Philippines. </p>

                <p>Hunter-gatherers were the early inhabitants of the Philippines. People did, however, learn to cultivate between 3,000 and 2,000 BC. Rice was grown, and domesticated animals were kept. Filipinos began trading with China in the 10th century AD, and by the 12th century AD, Arab traders had arrived in the Philippines, bringing Islam with them.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 id="SpanishColonialEra">Spanish Colonial Era</h4>
                <p>Ferdinand Magellan then traveled across the Pacific in 1521. When he arrived in the Philippines, he claimed the islands for Spain. Magellan baptized a leader named Humabon with the intention of using him as a puppet ruler for the Spanish crown. Other chiefs were ordered to submit to Humabon by Magellan, but one chief, Lapu Lapu, refused. Magellan commanded a troop to annihilate him. The Spanish soldiers, on the other hand, were dispersed, and Magellan was murdered.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards did not establish a presence in the Philippines until 1565, when Miguel Lopez de Legazpi led an expedition to Cebu and established a fort. The Spaniards arrived in Luzon in 1571. They established the city of Intramuros (later known as Manila), which became the Philippines' capital. Luzon was captured by Spanish conquistadors who marched inland. They established a feudal order. Filipinos toiled on enormous estates owned by Spaniards.</p>
                <p>A insurrection sprang out in Cavite in 1872, but it was promptly put down. However, with the help of a writer named Jose Rizal, nationalist sentiments continued to rise (1861-1896). He fueled the embers of nationalism with his writings Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibusterer). Jose Rizal formed the Liga Filipina movement in 1892, which advocated for change rather than revolt. Rizal was imprisoned and deported to Dapitan, Mindanao, as a result. </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Andres Bonifacio founded the Katipunan, a more radical organization. They started a revolt in August 1896. Jose Rizal, who did not support the revolution but was accused of doing so, was executed on December 30, 1896. His execution, on the other hand, enraged Filipinos and fueled the revolution.</p>

                <h4 id="AmericanColonialRule">American Colonial Rule</h4>
                <p>Then, in 1898, the United States and Spain went to war. The Americans defeated the Spanish armada in Manila Bay on April 30, 1898. Meanwhile, rebels from the Philippines had encircled Manila. On June 12th, its leader, Emilio Aguinaldo, declared the Philippines independent. Spain, on the other hand, gave the Philippines to the United States as part of the peace pact. The Americans intended to seize control.  On February 4, 1899, a war broke out between American forces in Manila and the Filipinos. The Philippine-American War lasted until Aguinaldo was captured in 1902.</p>
                <p>During the American Colonization, The American rule was considered paternalistic. 'Benevolent Assimilation' was the name of their policy. Many American teachers were dispatched to the Philippines, and they were successful in raising educational aspirations. The Philippines became a commonwealth and became semi-independent in 1935. Manuel Quezon was elected President of the Philippines. In 1945, the United States guaranteed that the Philippines would be entirely independent. </p>
                <p>Japan attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The Philippines were invaded by Japanese soldiers on December 10, 1941. On January 2, 1941, they took Manila. All of the Philippines had been under Japanese control by May 6, 1942. During October 1944, Douglas Macarthur returned to the Philippines. In February 1945, they successfully occupy Manila, afterwards, the Americans reform the independence of the Philppines. </p>
                <br>
                <h4 id="JapanColonialRule">Japan Colonial Rule</h4>
                <p>On the 8th of December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines were invaded. The initial Japanese onslaught badly destroyed American planes, much as it had done at Pearl Harbor. The American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines evacuated to Java on December 12, 1941, due to a lack of air cover. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered to leave Corregidor on the night of March 11, 1942, for Australia, a distance of 4,000 kilometers. On April 9, 1942, the 76,000 malnourished and scrawny American and Filipino defenders of Bataan surrendered, and were forced to suffer the infamous Bataan Death March, during which 7,000–10,000 people died or were murdered. On May 6, the 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered.</p>
                <p>Japan occupied the Philippines for more than three years before surrendering. Philippine resistance fighters held 60% of the islands, predominantly forest and mountain areas, thanks to a highly effective guerilla operation. MacArthur provided them with submarine supplies as well as reinforcements and officers. Filipinos stayed loyal to the US, partly because of the US assurance of independence, but also because the Japanese had forced significant numbers of Filipinos into labor details and forced young Filipino women into brothels.</p>
                <p>The fighting went on until Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945. By the end of the war, the Philippines had experienced a huge deal of death and physical destruction. In all, an estimated 527,000 Filipinos, both military and civilians, were slain; of these, between 131,000 and 164,000 were killed in 72 war crimes events.</p>

                <h4 id="IndependentRule">Independent Rule</h4>
                <p>On July 4, 1946, the Philippines declared independence. Manuel Roxas was the country's first president after its independence. During Manuel Roxas terms he established good economy to the country.</p>
                <p>Until In 1965, Ferdinand Marcos (1917-1989) continues to establish the economic status of the Philippines. The Philippines, on the other hand, was plagued by inequality. A land reform effort began in the 1960s. Many locals, however, were dissatisfied with its slow progress, and an insurgency erupted in the countryside. Marcos imposed martial law on September 21, 1972. He imposed a curfew, suspended Congress, and detained members of the opposition. Then, in 1980, opposition leader Benigno Aquino was forced to flee to the United States. He was shot when he returned on August 21, 1983. Aquino became a martyr, and his assassination enraged Filipinos. Marcos called an election in February 1986. The opposition rallied behind Cory Aquino, Benigno's widow. Marcos was declared the winner (a clear case of electoral fraud). Ordinary people came to the streets to demonstrate their support for Cory Aquino, who also declared victory. Marcos' supporters deserted him, and he surrendered to the inevitable and went into exile. Thus, the Marcos regime ends and enormously change the Country to suffered from economical catastrophic and immense debt until now.</p>
                <p>Corazon Aquino's term did not proceed as planned. (She managed desperately to avoid seven coup attempts.) Furthermore, many Filipinos believed that they should leave the American bases in the Philippines (Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base). After Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1992, engulfing Clark in volcanic ash and forcing the Americans to flee. In 1993, they fled Subic Bay. </p>
